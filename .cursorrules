- Tech stack: Python, Flask running on Kubernetes in production.
- Use a Python virtual environment called `.venv`. Activate the virtual environment before calling Python or installing requirements.
- Track dependencies in `requirements.txt`.
- Use OOP.
- Don't start the app yourself.
- Write Python type annotations.
- Don't pin PIP packages in the requirements.txt file.
- Keep .gitignore files as brief as possible.
- Don't add code that may be useful in the future like helper methods or scaffolding. Only write code that is of use for the feature being implemented.
- Use Python logging instead of print statements.
- Explicitly exclude the `.venv` folder when running commands like `find`.
