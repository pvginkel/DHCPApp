# Basic Flask Application Setup - Technical Plan

## Brief Description

Set up a basic Flask application that meets all requirements specified in the product brief without implementing any DHCP monitoring features yet. The application will establish the foundational structure for a "real-time network management tool designed for homelab environments" that will serve as "the data layer for a future Single Page Application (SPA) frontend, providing RESTful APIs and real-time data streaming capabilities."

The basic setup will follow the specified technology stack (Python with Flask web framework), use Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) design, run in a Python virtual environment (.venv), track dependencies in requirements.txt, and be prepared for local development with folder-based dnsmasq configuration access.

## Files to be Created

### Core Application Files

**app.py** - Main Flask application entry point
- Initialize Flask application instance
- Configure environment variable loading
- Set up basic error handling
- Define application factory pattern following OOP principles

**config.py** - Configuration management class
- Environment-based configuration handling
- Default values for development/production environments
- File and folder path configuration for dnsmasq lease file and configuration directories (as specified: "paths configured via environment variables")

**requirements.txt** - Python dependency management
- Flask web framework
- python-dotenv for environment variable management
- Additional dependencies for SSE and API development

**.env.example** - Environment variable template
- Example configuration for lease file and config folder paths
- Flask configuration variables
- Documentation for required environment variables

### Application Structure

**app/__init__.py** - Application package initialization
- Flask application factory function
- Blueprint registration setup
- Configuration loading

**app/models/__init__.py** - Models package
- Base model classes following OOP design
- Future DHCP lease and configuration models structure

**app/api/__init__.py** - API package initialization
- RESTful API blueprint setup
- API versioning structure

**app/api/v1/__init__.py** - API v1 package
- Version 1 API blueprint
- Route organization structure

**app/api/v1/routes.py** - Basic API routes
- Health check endpoint
- Basic status endpoint
- Placeholder structure for future DHCP endpoints

**app/services/__init__.py** - Services package
- Business logic layer following OOP principles
- Service class structure for future DHCP monitoring

**app/utils/__init__.py** - Utilities package
- Helper functions and utilities
- Common functionality shared across the application

### Development Files

**run.py** - Development server runner
- Flask development server initialization
- Debug mode configuration
- Entry point for local development

**.gitignore** - Git version control exclusions
- Python-specific ignores (__pycache__, .pyc files)
- Virtual environment exclusion (.venv)
- Environment files (.env)

## Implementation Steps

### Phase 1: Basic Project Structure
1. Create directory structure with app package and subpackages
2. Set up Python virtual environment (.venv) as specified
3. Create requirements.txt with Flask and essential dependencies
4. Initialize Git repository with appropriate .gitignore

### Phase 2: Flask Application Foundation
1. Implement application factory pattern in app/__init__.py
2. Create configuration management class in config.py
3. Set up basic Flask application in app.py with environment variable loading
4. Create development server runner in run.py

### Phase 3: API Structure
1. Create API blueprint structure in app/api/
2. Implement basic health check and status endpoints
3. Set up route organization for future DHCP endpoints
4. Establish RESTful API patterns

### Phase 4: OOP Foundation
1. Create base service classes in app/services/
2. Set up model structure in app/models/ for future DHCP entities
3. Implement utility classes in app/utils/
4. Establish inheritance patterns for future feature development

### Phase 5: Environment Preparation
1. Create environment variable template (.env.example)
2. Configure application for local development environment
3. Prepare for dnsmasq lease file and configuration folder access (file and folder path environment variables)

## Algorithms and Patterns

### Application Factory Pattern
- Use Flask application factory to create configurable app instances
- Enable different configurations for development/testing/production
- Support environment-specific settings

### Configuration Management
- Environment variable precedence: .env file < system environment variables
- Validate required configuration on startup
- Provide sensible defaults for development

### OOP Design Structure
- Service layer for business logic separation
- Model layer for data representation
- Clear separation of concerns between API, services, and models
- Inheritance patterns for future extensibility

### API Design Preparation
- RESTful endpoint structure ready for DHCP resources
- Consistent response format establishment
- Error handling patterns
- API versioning support (v1 structure)

## Environment Variables Required

- `FLASK_ENV` - Application environment (development/production)
- `FLASK_DEBUG` - Debug mode flag
- `DHCP_LEASE_FILE_PATH` - Path to dnsmasq lease file (placeholder)
- `DHCP_CONFIG_FOLDER_PATH` - Path to folder containing dnsmasq configuration files (placeholder)
- `HOST` - Flask application host (default: 0.0.0.0)
- `PORT` - Flask application port (default: 5000)

## Dependencies (requirements.txt)

- Flask - Web framework
- python-dotenv - Environment variable management
- flask-cors - CORS handling for future SPA integration

## Success Criteria

The basic Flask application setup is complete when:
1. Flask application starts without errors
2. Health check endpoint responds successfully
3. Environment variables load correctly
4. OOP structure is in place for future development
5. Virtual environment (.venv) is properly configured
6. All specified requirements are met without implementing DHCP features
